                Here's to the Crazy Ones!<br>
                The misfits.<br>
                The rebels.<br>
                The troublemakers.<br>
                The round pegs in the square holes.<br>
                The ones who see things differently.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                They're not fond of rules.<br>
                And they have no respect for the status quo.<br>
                You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them,<br>
                disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them.<br>
                About the only thing you cannot do is ignore them.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                Because they change things.<br>
                They invent. They imagine. They heal.<br>
                They explore. They create. They inspire.<br>
                They push the human race forward.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                Maybe they have to be crazy.<br>
                How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art?<br>
                Or, sit in silence and hear a song that's never been written?<br>
                Or, gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                We make tools for these kinds of people.<br>
                While some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.<br>
                “Because the people who are crazy enough to think they<br>
                can change the world, are the ones who do.”
